# Predicting Spatial Gene Expression from Histology in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer

This repository accompanies the poster **"Developing a Multi-Modal Framework to Infer Spatial Transcriptomic Profiles from Histology in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer"** by **Holly Rafique**, presented as part of research funded by the NIHR.

## Overview

Spatial transcriptomics enables high-resolution mapping of gene expression within the tumour microenvironment, but its clinical use is limited by cost and scalability. This project explores whether **spatial gene expression** can be inferred directly from **H&E-stained tissue images** using:

- **Pathology foundation models** (e.g., Virchow, UNI, Prov-GigaPath) for feature extraction
- **Traditional machine learning** algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Machines) for gene-wise prediction

Focusing on **triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)**, a highly heterogeneous and aggressive subtype, we demonstrate that spatial gene expression can be recovered with **clinically relevant accuracy** using only routine histology.

## Data

We selected a cohort of 64 TNBC patients from the Welcome Leap study.

## Methods Summary

- **Input:** H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs), spatial transcriptomic data (GeoMx DSP), immune (CD45‚Å∫) and epithelial (PanCK‚Å∫) AOIs.
- **Feature Extraction:** Virchow, UNI, and Prov-GigaPath pathology foundation models.
- **Targets:** Expression values for curated panels, highly variable genes (HVGs), and spatially variable genes (SVGs).
- **Modeling:** One ML model per gene using patient-level 5-fold cross-validation.
- **Evaluation:** Pearson correlation, R¬≤, nRMSE, and FDR-adjusted p-values on a held-out test set.

## Key Results

- **CD45‚Å∫ regions:**  
  - Panel genes: **PCC = 0.77**  
  - SVGs: **PCC = 0.75**  
  - HVGs: **PCC = 0.66**

- **PanCK‚Å∫ regions:**  
  - Panel genes: **PCC = 0.50**  
  - SVGs: **PCC = 0.46**  
  - HVGs: **PCC = 0.42**

The results demonstrate strong spatial concordance between predicted and measured expression‚Äîparticularly in immune-rich regions‚Äîsuggesting the viability of this framework as a cost-effective alternative to spatial transcriptomics.
